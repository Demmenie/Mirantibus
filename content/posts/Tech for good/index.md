In the last decade and a half we have seen the rise of many tech companies. The stated goal of these companies is often some sort of common good, which is to be reached by means of emerging technologies. Certainly there is something to be said for the value that these companies provide. Google's internal motto famously states, "Don't be evil", while their public mission is supposedly to "organise the world's information and make it universally accessible...". Similarly Facebook strives to connect people and "to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together".

## Good Intentions

If these companies, their stated goals and their founders are to be believed, then I believe that they have been led astray. Certainly if their goals are to drive humanity forward, then they seem to have misjudged the best vessel for that stated goal. Companies, by definition, are an entity with the main goal to create value with the purpose to enrich its investors; often that is the only goal.

The business model of most, if not all of the major tech companies is to collect their users' data and sell it or to advertise to their users, if not both. It is, therefore, in their commercial interests to do anything they can to keep their users on their platforms as long as possible in order to make as much money as possible. If the founders or executives of these companies wished for their organisation to have the goal of furthering humanity then perhaps their best move would not be to continue to rob their users of their attention but instead to serve their users as quickly and efficiently as possible and subsequently to direct them to leave their platform.

In order to serve their users in this way they would have to either rid themselves of the commercial interests entirely or to adopt a more sustainable business model, perhaps through something like becoming a "B Corp". This would legally bind them to not only making money but also to evaluating their impact on people; such as their employees and users, on the environment and on society as a whole. Ultimately though I do not believe that these organisations should have making money as a goal at all. 

## Why change is necessary

Companies such as Twitter and Facebook have an outsized influence on public discourse and on people generally. Technology has the power to massively disrupt existing sectors and to create entirely new ones. This power can be exercised for public good or for the purpose of making money.
