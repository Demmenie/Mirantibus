Commandment NÂº 6: Thy shalt not kill. Despite my religious absentia, this is a statement that, in principle, I can agree with. I think that most people do. If you are religious, then this is most likely a part of the religious text that you adhere to, in one form or another.

This religious attachment to the 'sin' of killing is in a way an interesting juxtaposition to the reality that throughout history there has been a massive amount of death perpetuated in the name of religion. Obviously the overwhelming majority of religious people are in fact incredibly peaceful. Mostly, people who commit murder or otherwise kill in the name of religion tend to be labelled as extremists or as people who have not read / have misinterpreted religious texts.

Religion is often also used as a source of morality. A place from where people can draw inspiration for their own moral compass. As an atheist I have no moral authority from which to draw inspiration; except for my own personal experiences, and judgements based on rational thinking (both my own and that of others).

But even later in the bible, we already see somewhat of a departure from the original language of the old testament from "Thy shalt not Kill" to "You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment." (Matthew 5:21) and "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder..." (Matthew 15:19). The difference between the words 'Kill' and 'Murder' often being interpreted as that murder is to kill with prejudice and intent whereas to kill is simply to end a life, intentionally or not.

This distinction is also most often also reflected in law; in most countries it perfectly legal to kill someone in self defence. There is the charge of murder, which has different levels of culpability, as well as manslaughter. The latter also being split into voluntary and involuntary based on gross negligence or foreseeability of fatality.

From whichever background you may stem, neither of which seems to me to be particularly superior; you most probably will agree that there are situations in which killing another human being may be justified. Humans, as well as most other animals, have an innate desire for self preservation: as well as for preservation of others. It follows therefore that given a situation in which you have little choice other than to kill, intentionally or not, or to be killed; most would choose the former. This is fairly uncontroversial but I think there are some interesting thought experiments that follow on from this assumption.
