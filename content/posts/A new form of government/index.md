Just over a year ago now I made a post here about a book that I had read regarding human nature called "Humankind: A hopeful history". The Author, Rutger Bregman; a historian and author, lays out historical and scientific studies that support the premise that humans, despite popular opinion, tend to do the right thing. The main part of the book simply goes through a laundry list of different examples that support this idea, but at the end of the book Bregman makes a more vague call to arms by adding examples of direct democracy being a more effective form of management, both in government and business.

The first example is of a Dutch care company, buurtzorg, which is split into smaller care teams of around 25 - 30 caregivers which largely self-manage. The only management involved is for the finance and marketing but they are similarly organised as groups that operate autonomously. This autonomy of smaller groups gives the company the flexibility to deal with issues on a local level and the freedom to innovate on their techniques without compromising on care quality. The company is now one of the largest care companies in the country, providing care at high quality while keeping costs low.

The second example given is a French car parts manufacturer which, after getting a new CEO, decided that management should be far less involved in the day to day running of the company, putting it largely in the hands of the engineers themselves. This change allowed them to organise the company in a similar way to buurtzorg. They still have a management structure but it is only employed when the engineers face an issue that they think would better be solved at a higher level by management. They have since seen a drop in defective product rates and an increase in profits.

Lastly the book introduces a town in south America which was once racked with corruption and practically run by a drug cartel. One man decided that he wanted the town to change for the better and ran for Mayor, but instead of simply promising reform and crackdowns on crime like so many others have done in the last century around the world, he decided that he would simply give the power the the Mayor's office holds back to the people. He would let the people vote on policy proposals, budgets and other matters relating to the running of the town.
