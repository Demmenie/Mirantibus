## [Aethra.video](https://github.com/Demmenie/Aethra)

This is a reverse video search engine; it allows you to link or upload a video and it will show you similar videos and a timeline of when they were first seen.
I made a [blog post](/posts/aethra) about how this works when the alpha first came out. You can find the website at [Aethra.video](https://aethra.video/).
